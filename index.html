			<h3> What is Fireberry Pi? </h3>
  		<p>Did you know	about 500 deaths occur every year due to gas leaks? We
			came to Bitcamp and created Fireberry Pi to combat this. The foundation
			of our project is a Raspberry Pi 3 and an Arduino Uno. The
			Uno is used as a micro controller which manages the input from our gas/smoke
			sensor. The Rasperry Pi is what connects all of our hardware to the web.</p>
			<h3>How does Fireberry Pi work? </h3>
  		<p>When the Uno detects a spike in gas levels, a series of commands are
				 executed. First, the Pi's camera is triggered and a text alert is sent out.
			 	 The user is able to take a look at the picture to assess any damages if
			   they are not at home. Secondly, a database is updated and location data
			 	 of smartphones associated with the system are pulled and mapped. This would
			 	 allow the user to be aware of anyone who may be at in danger at home.</p>
			<h3>What are our future plans? </h3>
	   	<p>At Bitcamp, we only had access to an MQ-4 gas sensor which limited us to
				 only detecting methane and butane (Which is what was used in our demo). We plan on adding
			   a variety of sensors to the Uno such as an MQ-2 sensor which would focus on
			 	 smoke. Also, we would like to create an enclosure which would allow for easy mounting
			 	 of the system around a house.</p>
